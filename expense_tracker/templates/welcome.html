        <h1>Welcome to Expense Tracker ðŸ’°</h1>
        <p>
            Managing personal finances is one of the most important habits for leading a secure and stress-free life.
            Yet, many people often lose track of their spending patterns, resulting in overspending and difficulty in
            achieving their savings goals. The <b>Expense Tracker App</b> has been built to solve this exact problem.
            This application allows you to record, monitor, and analyze your daily expenses in a structured and
            user-friendly way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app lets you categorize your expenses into common categories such as Food, Travel, Rent, Electricity
            Bill, Groceries, and more. Each expense entry records the amount, category, description, and date. Over
            time, these entries are summarized into detailed reports and visualizations. The app generates category-wise
            charts for every month so you can immediately see where most of your money is going. Whether you are a
            student trying to manage pocket money, a professional budgeting your salary, or a family keeping track of
            household expenses, this tool adapts to your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure security, the application comes with user authentication. Each user has their own private account
            where only their expenses are stored and displayed. This ensures complete privacy and personalization.
            With just a few clicks, you can log in, add your expenses, and view interactive pie charts that give you
            a clear picture of your financial health. By consistently using this app, you can develop better spending
            habits, set saving goals, and take full control of your finances.
